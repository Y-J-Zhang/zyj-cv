    date: '2021-08-21'
    awarder: Science of the Total Environment
    summary: |
      Given the discovery and hazard of microplastics in freshwater environments, the removal of microplastics in drinking water deserves more attention. Nevertheless, in the light of existing literature, the effectiveness of conventional coagulation on microplastics removal is insufficient. Hence, enhanced coagulation is worth being explored. This study investigated the improving performance of anionic polyacrylamide (PAM), sodium alginate (SA), and activated silicic acid (ASA) when using poly‑aluminum chloride (PAC) to remove polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microplastics...

    summary: |
      Lanthanum-doped sewage sludge-based activated carbon (AC-La), an environment-friendly material, can effectively remove fluoride ions from water. Regeneration performance of AC-La was mainly studied in this work. The results showed that compared to other elution methods, excellent regeneration performance of AC-La was achieved by NaOH. AC-La treated with 0.5 mol/L NaOH showed a high desorption rate (> 98.5%) and fluorine removal efficiency (ca.60%) again....

    awarder: Journal of Water Process Engineering
    summary: |
      Drinking water is probably the main route for microplastics to enter the human body. However, due to factors such as density and volume, MPs are difficult to remove during coagulation. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to study the removal efficiency of MPs in water supply treatment. Parameter optimization during coagulation, as well as the pre-oxidation process and addition of coagulant aids were investigated to explore the sedimentation efficiency of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS) MPs....

    summary: |
      In this study, the adsorption capacity of activated carbon was enhanced after zinc chloride activation. The effects of pore filling, n-π and π-π interaction and electrostatic interaction on the adsorption of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) by activated carbon were determined by SEM, BET, Raman spectrum, FTIR and surface Zeta potential....
